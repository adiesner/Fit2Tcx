Fit2Tcx Converter
================================

Tiny little command line programm to convert garmin fit files to tcx files.

Does not use the official ANT Library from www.thisisant.com, since the license is not compatible with open source projects. 

Only a part of all fit messages are implemented, since the target format tcx can only handle a small subset of all available fit messages.
